# Neural-Network-Implementation
My NN Implementation

This is my Neural Network Implementation, currently working on it to be able to handle the classic MNIST dataset. Working towards implementing
different cost functions / activation functions to see how it affects deep learning, as well as different strategies that help deep learning
learn faster, such as alternate learning algorithms other than Stochastic Gradient Descent (Conjugate-Gradient and Quasi-Newton Methods, as 
well as genetic algorithms).

Eventually, it is a goal to move towards convolutional neural networks since they seem to handle higher resolution images better, due to the number
of inputs in an image being lower, to handle the curse of dimensionality. I would also like to experiment with NEAT (genetic algorithms
in combination with varying the topology of a NN).
